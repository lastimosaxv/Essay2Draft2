<h2>Introduction</h2>


  <h3> Over the course of the last decade, the rap and hip-hop genre of music and most things associated, have received a bad connotation. A large consensus sees rap music as only being about drugs, sex, and violence. There are many instances of adults, more specifically parents, showing an intolerance to hip-hop as they believe it will have a bad influence on their children. However, I believe that the hip-hop genre is one of the most progressive genres in the industry, led by some of the smartest minds in all of music. Taking a deep dive into many popular hip-hop music videos will show us that there is an entire dimension of intellect that often goes overlooked by the general public. Many rappers produce their music videos in a calculated manner, in such a way that will garner an expected response or reaction from its viewers and to stand out from other music videos. A lot of these music videos have an incredible sense of storytelling, and know how to translate their music into visuals in a very seamless manner. Rappers can bring their thoughts to life through these music videos and convey a plethora of emotions and feelings that viewers can often relate to, giving these musicians a whole new level of depth and personality.</h3>

    <h2>"Laugh Now Cry Later" by Drake</h2>
    <h3>The music video for Drake’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” was released on August 14th, 2020 as the precursor to his next studio album. The overall message the video is trying to convey is the very namesake of the video, “Laugh Now Cry Later”, meaning that people should learn to live in the moment and leave the pain for later. The music video mostly consists of clips of Drake hanging out with various athletes and other celebrities, generally just having a good time. Drake is seen playing basketball with Kevin Durant, playing football with Odell Beckham Jr. and Marshawn Lynch, shopping with Aggy Abby, and various other activities. Throughout the video, there are a few points that interrupt the overall action of the video, such as the moment at 2:00, where Marshawn Lynch lays a huge tackle on Drake while playing football. The music stops in a “record scratch” style and Drake is left on the ground in pain as the music immediately resumes following the scene. </h3>
</div>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
    <h3>This juxtaposition may show Drake’s reality of being in pain or depression when he’s not on camera or in the face of the media. Especially being followed up by a scene of him, Beckham Jr., and Druski laughing together reflects that point as it shows his willingness to put his discomfort to the side so he can allow himself to have fun. This trend is seen in other places in the video, such as the small cuts to Drake crying while looking into the camera. At 3:15 in the video, Drake and Druski share a brief heart-to-heart moment as the music cuts out and it’s just them talking to each other as Druski basically asks Drake if he’s okay. It’s truly a warm moment as Druski helps Drake up in his moment of sorrow and takes him away from the scene, as it cuts back to the happier scenes and the music comes back in. Through this video, Drake wants the viewer to know the message of living life to the fullest and that life is too short to focus on one’s own pain.

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Drake sheds a tear while looking intently at the camera.</em></p>
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h3>In the scenes that cut to Drake crying, he makes it very obvious that he is in some state of pain or sadness. These shots are close ups of Drake's face, with tears rolling down his face. A study done by the National Library of Medicine shows that most people can identify common emotions on people just by their facial expression. In the article, Emotional Expression: Advances in Basic Emotion Theory, show the rates at which a group of participants could identify certain expressions. Of all of the expressions they tested for, sadness was one of the most missed, coming in third to last with barely 50% of the participants being able to identify it.


<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h3>This shows that even when it can be most obvious, some people can't tell if another person is sad or going through some sort of mental trauma. Drake reflects this fact as he has to physically showing himself crying in this music video to convey the idea that he feels this pain in his life and even though he has everything he could probably ask for, he's still human and has these natural emotions. On the outside, anyone would think that someone like Drake is always so happy, as he's always seen watching sporting events, hanging out with other celebrities and athletes, but in reality, he's just like most of us. Struggling to get through some days and sometimes breaking down and crying once in a while.</h3>

        <h2>"Many Men (Wish Death)" by 50 Cent</h2>
        <h3>Another music video that follows this trend of garnering a specific reaction through means of storytelling is 50 Cent’s “Many Men (Wish Death) from 2003. 50 Cent is most notably known for his rags-to-riches story, as he exploded onto the rap scene with his 2003 album, “Get Rich or Die Tryin’”, which this song happens to be from. The music video for “Many Men (Wish Death” has a very “movie style” of production, as in the specific way the video was shot was made to seem like it was a movie if taken out of its original context. </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>It opens with title cards in the same style that would typically be seen at the beginning of movies, then transitions to a scene of 50 Cent and some unknown character. 50 Cent narrates the opening and rewinds the film to an earlier portion. This opening sets the stage for the storytelling heavy aspect associated with this music video. 50 Cent uses his sense of storytelling in this music video much to his advantage as he reenacts his assassination attempt from 2000 in this video. Following the scene of the shooting, the music begins and the lyrics almost perfectly mimic the story he’s trying to tell here and his thoughts. The lines “Blood in my eye dawg and I can't see. I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be. And [expletive] trying to take my life away”, tell 50 Cent’s story in the simplest, yet most effective way.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Since birth, 50 Cent has been dealt a hard hand as he was born in a poor neighborhood, was surrounded by an array of bad influences, and resorted to crime early in his life. When things started looking up for him through his music, he’s instantly met with people out to kill him and ruin his future and career. 50 Cent reveals the harsh reality of his life and the lives of those that were dealt the same hand that he was when he was born. Throughout the rest of the video, he depicts his recovery from the shooting, including scenes of him in a hospital bed and in a wheelchair. 50 Cent also illustrates the aftermath of the shooting, including the investigation of figuring out who shot him, and interrogating alleged suspects. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>One of the more powerful lines in the song comes when he says, “Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain. Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain. Death gotta be easy 'cause life is hard. It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred”, as this is him accepting the harsh reality that life is. It speaks volumes for a celebrity like 50 Cent to be able to say this, as there’s often a stigma that the “1%” has it so easy compared to the average citizen, but in reality, they know far too well the same pains and struggles most “average” people face.</h3>
    </div>
    <img src="x1080.jpeg" alt="describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes" style="width:30%;" class="center-img">
    <p style="text-align: center"><em>50 Cent lays on the floor after being shot.</em></p>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
        <h3>The camera work and coloring of the video plays an important role as it contributes towards the overall meaning of the song. It creates a very sinister and harsh atmosphere, which suits the story of this music video nicely. This dark lighting adds a sense of dramatization to an already dark subject. The camerawork for the most part is very frantic and never focused on anything in particular, as if the camera isn’t on a stabilizer device to make the movements more fluid. I believe this was by design as it makes the viewer feel like they are part of the action happening in the video rather than being told what happened. It’s the video’s way of immersing the viewer to feel included, thus creating a different type of connection with them that allows them to understand the video’s message on a more complex level.</h3>

    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
        <h2>"XO Tour Llif3" by Lil Uzi Vert</h2>
        <h3>Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Llif3” released in 2017 is one of, if not the, most popular songs in his entire discography. One of the main takeaways from the song’s success is most definitely it being so easy to relate to and understand the emotions Lil Uzi is going through. The music video for this song illustrates the song’s uniqueness and brilliance through the specific design choices the producers went with. The primary producer of the music video was Virgil Abloh, the designer for Louis Vuitton and founder of the brand Off-White. Abloh is known for his strange, yet unique designs for fashion, and his tastes are reflected in this music video.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>The video opens with a very eerie scene and has a VHS grain overlaid on top of the footage. This stylistic choice reminds me of the “found footage” genre of movies like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activities, which sets the tone immediately for what kind of themes this music video may play into. It is then revealed that what we saw in the beginning scene was recorded by Virgil Abloh, as it shifts to a third person view of him holding the camera. Although it is slightly unclear what Abloh is exactly recording, from the looks of it, it seems to be a crime scene of sorts. As the music video continues and the song starts to play in the background, it becomes evident early on what Lil Uzi wants to convey to viewers. The video centers around this demonic lady with pale skin and blood on her face, and Lil Uzi, who’s depicted in many scenes to be dying, or at least fighting for his life, as annotated by him laying in a pool of blood. At the time this song was released, Lil Uzi had just gone through a break-up with his former girlfriend, Brittany Byrd.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Lil Uzi may be trying to expose the destructive nature of his relationship with her through this video and some of the extreme visuals. The demonic lady that is shown throughout the video could be Lil Uzi’s representation of not just his former girlfriend, but the relationship as a whole. In the chorus, Lil Uzi says, “She said, ‘Baby, I am not afraid to die’. Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead. Push me to the edge”, which may show just how toxic his relationship with Byrd really was. These words sound like the same words people use to guilt trip others, as Byrd could have been telling Lil Uzi that she would commit suicide if he broke up with her. Through this video and song, Lil Uzi is conveying the sense of feeling trapped in a bad situation, where no matter what he does to try and fix things, someone is going to be emotionally hurt. </h3>
    </div>
    <img src="MV5BMDQyODA3NDUtODQxNi00NjRjLTlmNmEtNThmOGJmMzkxNDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTQ2NDA3Mjc@._V1_.jpg" alt="describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes" style="width:30%;" class="center-img">

    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>The visuals of this music video mirror Lil Uzi’s mental state during this time of his life as the video can be chaotic and hard to digest at certain moments. Virgil Abloh and Lil Uzi use several jump cuts throughout the video, but specifically from the 2:30 to 2:55 mark is when it is most prominent and holds the most gravity. The video cuts from many different scenes and takes the action in many different places, almost signifying how much of a mess Lil Uzi’s mental state might have been during this time. During this timeframe, Lil Uzi makes this video “glitch” in a way that is meant to unsettle, yet draw the viewer in closer to the action. This frantic action along with the demonic imagery and arabic subtitles make the video more cryptic as whole, which is most likely what Lil Uzi wanted to strive for. </h3>

        <p>The True Meaning of XO Tour Lif3 Music Video | Lil Uzi EXPLAINED by Pearl Fountain on YouTube.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>In the Youtube video, “The True Meaning of XO Tour Llif3 Music Video” by Pearl Fountain, they analyze other details in the music video and give their interpretations. They define the demon in the music video as something different than what I have interpreted it as. Pearl Fountain points out that in the video, the demon and Lil Uzi are seen to be laying in the same bathtub in consecutive shots. Rather than the demon representing his romantic life and relationship with his girlfriend, they interpret the demon as a symbol of his life as a whole. The line “All my friends are dead” references the fact that Lil Uzi has lost a lot of his real-life friends and possibly that all of his friends are “dead presidents” a common form of slang used for money. Both of these interpretations show the fact that Lil Uzi has become a shell of himself and has used his immense wealth to cover that up and is quite literally suffering from success.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Lil Uzi exerts many different emotions throughout this video and it can be seen that he is in a lot of emotional and mental stress. The stress of having no real friends, breaking up with his girlfriend, and being too rich for his own good could well be his way of humanizing himself as an artist and giving his personality another level of depth and complexity. The personal image that Lil Uzi displays are the feelings and emotions many people experience daily, whether it be from a recent breakup, being rejected, feeling like they have failed, or anything else negative. These feelings are the reason people turn to Lil Uzi’s music for comfort; he’s relatable in the sense that he knows exactly what his listeners may have gone through and his music might be his way of saying “I’m here for you”.</h3>

        <h2>"Goosebumps" by Travis Scott and Kendrick Lamar</h2>
        <h3>This last music video in particular is very interesting, as it deviates from all 3 in style as it isn’t necessarily attempting to tell a story, but describe a feeling. Travis Scott, along with Kendrick Lamar,  released “goosebumps” in 2017 and is easily one of his most recognizable songs to date. In “goosebumps” Travis Scott uses a multitude of different visual effects and camera techniques to evoke the literal feeling of goosebumps out of the viewer. The only action that occurs throughout the course of the video is a party with Travis Scott and Kendrick Lamar, but the effects that are overlaid on top of the video make it hard to distinguish what exactly is happening.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Wild and bright colors are primarily used through the whole video, adding to the party theme, while also contributing to the feeling of excitement and based on the lyrics, possibly sexual arousal. In the lyrics, Travis Scott makes it clear that he gets all these strange and different feelings when around a certain woman. The lyrics, “I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah. You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine. Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah. It's way too dumb, yeah”, show that Travis Scott could possibly be talking about being in love. This feeling he’s describing is much more than just liking somebody or having a slight attraction, but a real passionate love for someone.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>He talks about getting goosebumps when they’re with him as he could possibly be worried about not messing anything up with this person. Travis Scott makes it clear that whoever he’s talking about is his comfort person, his rock, so to say. He feels comfortable around this person and doesn’t care about what people are going to say about him or the person he’s with. The way Travis Scott sings those lines is much slower than the way he sings in other parts of the song. His voice is softer, smoother, and deeper, which could indicate his sincere feelings for this person and him trying to express himself in a meaningful way.</h3>

        <p>The Making Of Travis Scott's "goosebumps" Video With BRTHR | Framework by Genius on YouTube.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>In a YouTube video posted by Genius titled “The Making of Travis Scott’s “goosebumps” Video with BRTHR”, the directors of the music video explain why they designed the video the way they did. One of their main goals was to create something striking, something that would be remembered long after the music video’s initial release. It seems as if the video was made with no real direction and just went with whatever seemed like a good idea. This attitude actually helps them as it makes the video much more chaotic and adds to the theme of the actual song. In the comments of this video, James Larsen says that this video is “just like tripping acid at a party with imagery that burns into your skull”. There are many other comments similar to this one saying that this video is extremely memorable and unique, which shows that BRTHR was able to create something that people would have a hard time forgetting. There’s truly no better way of illustrating a song that talks about indescribable emotions than a music video that is indescribable in its own respect.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>In the “For the Record: Designing Realities” video, they specifically state that, “it can either be a coherent world that makes sense, is mappable, and is fundamentally understandable. Or it isn’t … [these types of worlds] make room for diversity.” What they mean by this quote is that directors and visual effects artists can create essentially anything they want to through music videos and either make something familiar to the viewer, or something wildly unique and never before seen. BRTHR chose to make the video hard to visually interpret as anyone can interpret this video however they want to. Someone can pull the feelings of love from this music video, while others can focus on the pain and anguish Travis Scott exhibits at certain parts. Travis Scott describes a feeling that many people have probably felt before, but just didn’t know how to exactly describe it due to it being such a weird sensation.</h3>

        <h2>21st Century Outlook</h2>
        <h3>The trends displayed in these music videos are so relevant to today’s society, as many of the themes relate to what we see in our everyday lives and in the news. In the wake of Takeoff, member of the rap group “Migos”, being shot and killed recently, the message 50 Cent is trying to send through his music is more important now than ever. He explains that the world is a cold place, and no matter where someone comes from or what their background is, anything can and will happen at any given moment. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Takeoff isn’t even the only rapper to be tragically taken away from us in recent memory as just this year, PnB Rock was shot and killed in a restaurant with his family, and in 2020, both King Von and Pop Smoke were killed in shootings. 50 Cent was very fortunate to have survived and arguably worse shooting and is able to spread his message and philosophy to the rest of the world and bring eyes to some of the harsh realities rappers and celebrities face on a daily basis.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>The other 3 music videos focus more primarily on emotional pain and the feeling of being in and out of love. Drake, Lil Uzi Vert, and Travis Scott are easily some of the most recognizable names in the industry because of their music and success. Their successes, in my opinion, come from their ability to make their work so easily digestible and relatable. Everyone knows the feeling of being in love for the first time, being heartbroken, or being upset with the world because nothing is looking up. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>I believe this is solid evidence to back up the notion that hip-hop is one of the most diverse genres in music and can be so expressive of complex emotions. Growing up listening to hip-hop, my parents, teachers, and other adults would always say that listening to hip-hop is bad for the youth and will “rot your brain”. This is due to the outdated statement that rap is only about greed, sex, and violence. I personally think that hip-hop does a lot of good in the music industry as it shows listeners that it is okay to express certain emotions and that they’re not alone. Hip-hop continues to be one of the fastest growing genres in music because of how easy it can be to listen and relate to certain artists as their music is so accessible. </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Hip-hop has been notorious over the last few years for being annotated as a bad influence on the younger generation and people in general. However, the music videos previously talked about have shown their brilliance in storytelling and conveying certain emotions and feelings. The musicians and producers behind these videos have each found their own unique method of immersing the viewer into the video and emphasizing certain aspects to draw a calculated response from the viewer.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">

        <h3>Whether that response is sympathetic, painful, sad, or even causes goosebumps, all of these music videos succeed in doing what they sought out to do in the beginning. I feel that this trend is good for the rap genre as it helps people understand these musicians and their stories, along with being very relatable to the average viewer. I personally have reminisced with music videos and their messages and know other people who have as well. More music videos, even outside of hip-hop, should adapt the ways in which these videos were produced in order to draw a better, more personal connection with their viewers.</h3>
